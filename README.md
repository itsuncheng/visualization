3D Visualization of Chinese Word Embeddings

This website shows a 3D visualization of word embeddings of Chinese characters. A form is also provided to select k-nearest
neighbor words given a word based on some filter options. 

The website mainly operates on the front end, which is written in Javascript and [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/), and assumes
the API call works on the backend for k-nearest neighbor.
